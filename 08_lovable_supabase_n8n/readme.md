# üìò Tutorial: Building a Full-Stack AI Application with Lovable.dev, Supabase & n8n

This tutorial is based on this video tutorial [I Built a FULL Web App with n8n, Lovable & Supabase (NO CODE!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niMkgYRZfMk)


This tutorial walks you through building a modern full-stack application that integrates **Lovable.dev** (no-code UI builder), **Supabase** (backend database + authentication), and **n8n** (workflow automation). By the end, you‚Äôll have an app that supports:

* üîê User authentication (sign-up & login)
* üìÇ File upload & deletion (stored in Supabase)
* ü§ñ AI-powered Q\&A over your uploaded documents (RAG workflow with vector embeddings)

Perfect for client projects or personal experiments!

## 1. Project Overview

The app has three main features:

1. **Authentication** ‚Äì Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles stored in Supabase.
2. **File Management** ‚Äì Users can upload PDFs, which are stored in Supabase and vectorized into embeddings. Files can also be deleted.
3. **Chat with Files** ‚Äì A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow lets users ask natural-language questions about uploaded files.

The architecture looks like this:

```
Frontend (Lovable.dev) ‚Üî n8n Workflows ‚Üî Supabase (Database + Vector Store)
```

## 2. Setting Up Supabase

1. **Create a Project** in [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

2. **Enable Authentication**:

   * Use the built-in `profiles` table to store user accounts.
   * Optionally configure email confirmation.

3. **Create Tables**:

   * `files` ‚Äì to track uploaded files.
   * `vector_data` ‚Äì to store document embeddings.
   * `chat_memory` (optional) ‚Äì to store past interactions for better responses.

4. **Enable Database Webhooks**:

   * Go to **Integrations ‚Üí Database Webhooks**.
   * Create two webhooks:

     * **Upload File** ‚Üí triggers n8n to process new uploads.
     * **Delete File** ‚Üí triggers n8n to remove documents & vectors.

## 3. Building the Frontend with Lovable.dev

1. **Create an App** on [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/).

2. **Design the UI**:

   * Homepage with **Sign Up / Login** buttons.
   * A dashboard with:

     * File upload button.

     * File list with delete option.

     * Chat interface.

   > üí° Tip: You can generate the UI by providing Lovable with a screenshot or a prompt like:
   > *‚ÄúCreate a modern web app UI with authentication, file upload, and chat interface.‚Äù*

3. **Connect to Supabase**:

   * Lovable has a built-in Supabase integration.
   * Provide your Supabase project name and API keys.
   * Confirm database tables (`profiles`, `files`, etc.) are detected.

4. **Make Buttons Functional**:

   * Ensure **Sign Up / Sign In** buttons call Supabase Auth.
   * Ensure **Upload File** button stores the file in Supabase Storage.
   * Ensure **Delete File** button calls the Supabase webhook.

## 4. Automating Workflows with n8n

Now, let‚Äôs wire everything together with **n8n**.

### (a) File Upload Workflow

* **Trigger**: Supabase webhook (file uploaded).
* **Steps**:

  1. Retrieve file metadata (name, ID, size).
  2. Download the file from Supabase Storage.
  3. Extract text from the PDF.
  4. Vectorize content (create embeddings).
  5. Insert into `vector_data` table.

### (b) File Deletion Workflow

* **Trigger**: Supabase webhook (file deleted).
* **Steps**:

  1. Identify vectors linked to the file.
  2. Remove them from the `vector_data` table.

### (c) Chat with Files Workflow

* **Trigger**: Frontend query (Lovable ‚Üí webhook).
* **Steps**:

  1. Receive user‚Äôs question.
  2. Query `vector_data` for relevant chunks.
  3. Pass results into an **AI Agent** (via OpenAI, Claude, or other LLM).
  4. Return the response back to the frontend.

## 5. Testing the Application

1. **Authentication Test**

   * Create a new account from the frontend.
   * Check that the new profile appears in Supabase.

2. **File Upload Test**

   * Upload a PDF resume.
   * Verify the file appears in Supabase ‚Üí `files` table.
   * Check that embeddings are stored in `vector_data`.

3. **Chat Test**

   * Ask: *‚ÄúWhere did \[Person] go to college?‚Äù*
   * Confirm the AI retrieves the correct answer from the resume.

4. **File Deletion Test**

   * Delete the uploaded file.
   * Ensure vectors are removed from `vector_data`.

## 6. Key Takeaways

* **Lovable.dev** makes it easy to design and deploy frontends without coding.
* **Supabase** provides scalable authentication, storage, and a vector-enabled database.
* **n8n** automates workflows, connecting frontend actions with backend processes.
* The combination enables **RAG applications** that are simple to build yet powerful in capability.

---

## 7. Next Steps

* Add **email verification** for more secure signups.
* Store **chat history** for persistent sessions.
* Extend workflows to handle multiple file types (e.g., DOCX).
* Deploy the app and share with clients or your community.

‚úÖ With this setup, you now have a **production-ready AI document assistant** powered by **Lovable.dev + Supabase + n8n**.
