# Prompt Engineering Tutorial for Nano Banana

*By Example ‚Äî with Real Prompts and Outputs*

Prompt at https://gemini.google.com/

Google Nano Banana (like MidJourney, DALL¬∑E, or Stable Diffusion) responds to highly descriptive prompts. The more structured, visual, and contextual your input, the closer the output matches your intent.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Specificity Over Generality**
- Vague: "a nice portrait"
- Better: "hyper-realistic studio portrait with professional lighting"

### 2. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Start with the main subject
- Add environment/background
- Specify lighting and mood
- Include technical details

### 3. **Professional Photography Language**
- Use camera terminology (85mm lens, f/1.4, shallow depth of field)
- Reference lighting setups (Rembrandt lighting, studio lighting)
- Mention photography styles (editorial, cinematic, fine art)

## Anatomy of Effective Prompts

A well-structured prompt typically includes:
1. **Subject Description** (who/what)
2. **Pose/Action** (body language, positioning)
3. **Environment** (background, setting)
4. **Lighting** (type, direction, mood)
5. **Style** (aesthetic, genre)
6. **Technical Specifications** (camera settings, composition)
7. **Mood/Atmosphere** (emotional tone)

## üîπ Example 1: Professional Branding Portrait

**Prompt Used (from your case):**

```
Hyper-realistic full-body portrait of the uploaded photo, standing casually against a smooth light-gray wall. The outfit is as worn as in winter. The hands are inside the pockets, the left hand wears a square smartwatch, one leg casually crossed over the other, relaxed and confident posture. The lighting is a professional studio, bright yet soft, premium clarity.

On the wall beside him is a bold black-and-white stylized vector portrait of the same subject, rendered with modern geometric accents. Beneath the graphic, add clean bold text 'Zia Khan' in large type, and below it is a smaller font 'Agentic AI Developer'

Mood & Style: modern, minimalistic, premium personal-branding aesthetic, sharp contrast, sleek composition.
```

‚úÖ **What Worked Here**

* **Subject grounding**: ‚Äúof the uploaded photo‚Äù ensures consistency.

* **Context & setting**: ‚Äúsmooth light-gray wall, professional studio lighting‚Äù makes it brand-safe.
* **Extra elements**: vector portrait + typography = personal brand identity.

üí° **Takeaway Rule:** *For branding prompts, combine subject grounding + posture + context + design elements (like logos or text).*
