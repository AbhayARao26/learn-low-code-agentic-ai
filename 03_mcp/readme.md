# Model Context Protocol (MCP) with n8n

## I. Using MCP Servers with n8n Agents

We will cover this tutorial in class:

[The Ultimate n8n MCP Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners | 2025](https://generect.com/blog/n8n-mcp/)

n8n interacts with MCP as an MCP client via the [MCP Client Tool node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) to use external tools by connecting to MCP servers with authentication. Additionally, n8n acts as an MCP server through the [MCP Server Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/) to expose its tools and workflows using SSE and configurable URLs with authentication
