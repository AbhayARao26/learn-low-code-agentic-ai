# AI Agents

We will cover these tutorials in class:

### **Step 1: Understand the Fundamentals**

Start by grasping the core concepts behind AI agents. This will give you a solid theoretical foundation before you dive into the practical aspects.

* **[AI Agents Explained: From Theory to Practical Deployment](https://blog.n8n.io/ai-agents/)**: This article will introduce you to the theory of AI agents, their components, and how they can be used.
* **[AI agentic workflows: a practical guide for n8n automation[(https://blog.n8n.io/ai-agentic-workflows/)**
This bridges the gap between theory and n8n-specific implementation. It also gives you real-world automation use cases.

### **Step 2: Your First Hands-On Project**

Now that you have the theoretical knowledge, it's time to build your first agent. These resources will give you both a step-by-step guide and a visual demonstration.

* **[Build an AI chat agent with n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/intro-tutorial/)**: This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple but functional AI chat agent.
* **[AI Agent Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)*:
Once you’ve built your first agent, dive into the docs for the AI Agent node to understand all its configuration options, so you can tweak and expand beyond the tutorial.
* **[n8n Just Made Multi Agent AI Way Easier: New AI Agent Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW5xEm7iSXk)**: Watch this video to get a visual understanding of the new AI Agent Tool and how it simplifies the process. It's a great companion to the hands-on tutorial.

### **Step 3: Dive Deeper into Agentic Workflows**

With a basic agent under your belt, you can now explore the more practical aspects of creating agentic workflows for automation.

* **[AI agentic workflows: a practical guide for n8n automation](https://blog.n8n.io/ai-agentic-workflows/)**: This guide provides practical insights into designing and implementing more complex agentic workflows in n8n.

***

### **Step 4: Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems**

Once you're comfortable with single agents, you can move on to the more advanced topic of multi-agent systems, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a goal.

* **[Building your first multi-agent system with n8n](https://medium.com/mitb-for-all/building-your-first-multi-agent-system-with-n8n-0c959d7139a1)**: This article will guide you through the process of creating your first multi-agent system.

***

### **Step 5: Advanced and Community-Driven Examples**

To further enhance your skills, explore real-world examples and advanced techniques shared by the n8n community.

* **[How I Built a Multi-Agent AI System in n8n Using Sub-Workflows example](https://community.n8n.io/t/how-i-built-a-multi-agent-ai-system-in-n8n-using-sub-workflows-example/120176)**: This community post offers a detailed walkthrough of a complex multi-agent system using sub-workflows.

***

### **Reference Materials and Templates**

Keep these resources handy as you work through the steps above. They provide detailed information on specific nodes and ready-to-use templates.

* **[AI Agent node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)**: The official documentation for the AI Agent node. Use this as a reference for all the available options and settings.
* **[AI agent chat](https://n8n.io/workflows/1954-ai-agent-chat/)**: A pre-built workflow that you can import and dissect to understand how a chat agent is constructed.
