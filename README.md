# Agentic AI Development with n8n

**n8n** (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is an open‑source workflow automation and orchestration platform. It lets you connect APIs, databases, and services with a visual, node‑based editor, while still giving you the power to drop into code when you need it. For agentic AI, that combination—**no‑code orchestration with just‑enough code**—makes n8n an ideal control plane for building systems that can **perceive, plan, and act** across tools.

To start using n8n for free setup on your local machine:
