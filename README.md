# Agentic AI Development with n8n

**n8n** (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is an open‑source workflow automation and orchestration platform. It lets you connect APIs, databases, and services with a visual, node‑based editor, while still giving you the power to drop into code when you need it. For agentic AI, that combination—**no‑code orchestration with just‑enough code**—makes n8n an ideal control plane for building systems that can **perceive, plan, and act** across tools.

To start using n8n for free setup on your local machine:

NPM:

### What is “Agentic AI”?

Agentic AI goes beyond single‑prompt LLM usage. Agents:

* **Sense**: gather context from users, webhooks, files, or APIs
* **Reason & Plan**: choose goals and next actions based on tool results
* **Act**: call external tools/services, write to systems, trigger workflows
* **Reflect**: evaluate outcomes, update memory, and iterate

In this course, you’ll learn to implement that loop in n8n so your AI can coordinate real work—safely, observably, and repeatably.

### Why n8n for agentic systems?

* **Composable tool use**: Call any API with HTTP Request nodes; integrate popular LLM providers; enrich with DBs, vector stores, and third‑party apps.
* **Event‑driven by default**: Start agents with webhooks, cron schedules, queues, or app triggers.
* **Memory & context handling**: Store and retrieve state using Data Stores, external DBs, or vector search to ground your agent’s decisions.
* **Human‑in‑the‑loop**: Insert approvals, fallback paths, and guardrails; capture feedback and escalate when confidence is low.
* **Observability**: Log steps, inspect inputs/outputs, and version your workflows to make agents debuggable.
* **Deployment flexibility**: Self‑host for full control or use n8n Cloud; secure credentials with environment variables and built‑in secrets.

### What you’ll build

By the end, you’ll have a production‑ready agentic stack that can:

* Ingest signals (webhooks, forms, files, or messages)
* Plan multi‑step actions with reasoning loops
* Use tools (search, RAG, structured APIs) and write back to systems
* Maintain working memory and long‑term knowledge
* Monitor itself with metrics, retries, and safety checks

### How this course is structured

1. **Foundations**: Agentic patterns, prompts, schemas, and safety.
2. **n8n Essentials**: Triggers, nodes, routing, error handling, and data mapping.
3. **Tool Use & RAG**: Connecting APIs, building retrieval pipelines, and handling structured outputs.
4. **Planning & Control**: Designing loops, break conditions, and self‑reflection.
5. **HITL & Guardrails**: Thresholds, moderation, and approvals.
6. **Shipping**: Environments, secrets, testing, monitoring, and cost control.

### What you’ll need

* Basic familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript for function nodes (helpful, not mandatory)
* Access to an LLM provider key (e.g., OpenAI, etc.)
* An n8n instance (self‑hosted or cloud)

**Let’s get started.** You’ll learn to turn LLM capabilities into dependable, auditable workflows—so your AI doesn’t just answer, it *gets things done*.
